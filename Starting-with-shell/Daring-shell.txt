The first challenge is to create a shell that automates the whole environment setup for nodejs or other programming languase setup

the  idea is to create sample like that 

setupEnvironment('nodejs')
mkdir routes,views,public,config,middleware,auth,models

npm init --yes 
npm install --save 
nodemon index.js

//this is the little part of this code should do
